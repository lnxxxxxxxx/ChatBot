  '98765432', '11111111', '12345678'.
  
  2. Then, it will connect to the 'ChatBotDefault' API where you will have access to some default responses until you select option 3, 4 or 5.
   
  3. Option 3 will connect you to the 'ChatBotSpringboot' API where through the GET method you will return the client's consumption of the database, and you will continue with the 'ChatBotDefault' API running normally.
   
  4. Option 4 will connect you to the 'ChatBotSpringboot' API where through the GET method it will return the customer's debt from the database, and continue with the 'ChatBotDefault' API running normally.
   
  5. Option 5 will connect you to the API 'ChatIA' where through the POST method you will have access to chat with an artificial intelligence created personally to get your concerns.
